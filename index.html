<h1>Doomed.Money</h1>

<p>This is a placeholder page, put up on an emergency basis.  I now have at hand urgent tasks other than web development.</p>

<p>However, this site will be my primary point of contact.  Please bookmark and link to this, not Twitter or other totally centralized information silos.</p>

<p><em>Less centralization.  Less, not more.  One step at a time.</em></p>
